# Grand Valley State University Research Project

## Neural Network Repository

Welcome to the Grand Valley State University research project repository! This repository hosts a custom neural network class and two subdirectories for implementing autoencoders and variational autoencoders. These components are part of an ongoing research project conducted at Grand Valley State University.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `neural_network`: This directory contains the custom neural network class. This class is a fundamental component of the research project, providing the foundation for various experiments and models.

- `autoencoder`: In this directory, you'll find the implementation of an autoencoder, a neural network used for unsupervised learning tasks such as dimensionality reduction and feature extraction.

- `variational_autoencoder`: This directory houses the implementation of a variational autoencoder (VAE). A VAE is a generative model used for generating data and exploring latent spaces.
